# Weather Star 4000+ (BETA)

Welcome to the Weather Star 4000+ source code!  This project was originally created by Mike Battaglia in the Fall of 2016 because of wanting to create his own weather site which displayed the information in a way that was done by the Weather Channel in the mid to late 90's.  Eventually he watched enough videos and YouTube and read enough articles on how to get and parse data directly from the National Weather Service (NWS) that he was able to create his own version of the site.  After three interations, he is now considering the site feature complete and you can view the live version here: https://battaglia.ddns.net/twc/twc2.html
